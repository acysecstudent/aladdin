# Aladdin

Aladdin is my side project — a beginner-friendly Python-based CLI recon tool with a simple menu interface. It's designed to help students and aspiring ethical hackers automate basic reconnaissance tasks like domain info, IP lookup, and web scanning. Built to be easy, clean, and a little bit magical. 🧞‍♂️
